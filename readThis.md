Challenge Statement:
The Internal Brain – Building a Context-Aware Enterprise
Knowledge System with RBAC, Security Logging & Audit
Trail
Introduction
Modern enterprises are knowledge organisms. Every day, thousands of decisions,
conversations, tickets, and documents are scattered across a constellation of platforms —
Confluence for wikis and documentation, Jira for issue tracking and project management, Slack
for real-time team communication, and Google Drive for file storage and collaboration.
The problem is not a lack of information. It is the opposite: an overwhelming abundance of
information that no single person can hold in their head, no single search can surface, and no
single access control model governs. An engineer answering an incident at 3 AM may need to
cross-reference a Jira ticket, three Slack threads, a Confluence runbook, and a Google Drive
postmortem — each living in a different system with different permissions, different formats,
and different freshness.
This challenge asks you to build the connective tissue: an Internal Brain — an AI-augmented
system that unifies context across these four platforms, answers natural-language questions
grounded in that unified context, and does so under the uncompromising constraint that every
piece of information it exposes respects the original platform’s access controls, with full
auditability of who asked what, what was retrieved, and what was answered.
This is not a chatbot bolted onto search. It is a governed, permission-aware knowledge fabric
with an LLM reasoning layer on top — the kind of system that enterprises actually need, and
that most current “AI assistants” conspicuously fail to deliver because they ignore access
control and auditability entirely

Problem Statement
Consider a mid-to-large technology company, Company A, with the following footprint:
Confluence: 50+ spaces, 12,000+ pages, granular space-level and page-level permissions
(some spaces restricted to specific teams, individual pages restricted to named individuals).
Jira: 30+ projects, custom role schemes per project, issue-level security (e.g., security-sensitive
bugs visible only to the security team).
Slack: 200+ channels across multiple workspaces, including private channels and DMs;
message retention policies; thread context that is critical but deeply nested.
Google Drive: Shared drives and personal drives, file-level and folder-level sharing
(view/comment/edit), external sharing enabled for some folders.
Company A’s employees waste an estimated 30% of their workweek searching for information,
asking colleagues “where is the doc for X,” or re-asking questions that were answered six
months ago in a Slack thread they can’t find. The CTO wants an AI assistant that can answer
questions like:
“What was the root cause of the payment outage last quarter, and what follow-up tickets were
created?”
“Summarize the design discussion around the new auth service from last sprint’s Slack threads
and link the Confluence decision doc.”
But the CTO immediately raises the hard question: If this AI assistant can read everything, can
it also leak everything? A junior engineer asking “show me all security vulnerabilities” should
not receive pages from a Confluence space restricted to the security team. An external
contractor in a Slack workspace should not be able to query internal Jira issues. Every answer
must be scoped to what the asker is actually authorized to see, and there must be a tamperevident record of every retrieval and every answer.

Challenge
Build the Internal Brain that delivers unified, AI-augmented answers across all four platforms
while enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) end-to-end, with security logging and a full
audit trail. This Internal Brain should be able to:
• Heterogeneous Source Integration: Each platform has its own API, its own data model, its
own pagination, its own rate limits, and its own permission semantics. Confluence
permissions are space+page based. Jira permissions are project-role-issue based. Slack
permissions are channel-membership based. Google Drive permissions are file-folder-user
based. You must build a unified ingestion and retrieval layer that does not flatten these
differences away — because flattening them means breaking access control.
• Permission-Aware Retrieval: Most “AI over your data” demos retrieve documents into an
LLM context with no regard for who is asking. That is a non-starter here. The retrieval
pipeline must:
o Know the identity and roles/permissions of the asker at query time.
o Filter candidate documents before they reach the LLM, so the model never even sees
content the user is not allowed to see (preventing both answer leakage and promptinjection-via-retrieved-content attacks).
o Handle permission changes: if a user’s access to a Confluence page is revoked between
ingestion and query, the system must not serve stale-permitted content.
• Context Assembly Across Platforms: A single answer may require stitching context from
multiple sources — a Jira ticket, its linked Slack discussion, the related Confluence doc, and
an attached GDrive file. You must design a retrieval strategy that can fan out across
platforms, rank cross-platform results, and assemble a coherent context window for the LLM
— all while respecting per-platform permissions on every constituent piece.
• Security Logging & Audit Trail: Every meaningful action must be recorded in a way that is:
o Tamper-evident — an auditor can detect if a log entry was modified or deleted.
o Complete — captures who (identity), what (query + retrieved doc IDs + final answer), when
(timestamp), and the authorization decision (allowed/denied per document).
o Queryable — an admin or compliance officer can ask “what did user X access last week” or
“who retrieved this sensitive doc

 LLM Safety in a Permissioned World: Even if retrieval filters correctly, the LLM might
hallucinate, paraphrase restricted content it saw in training, or leak information through
confident confabulation. The solution must mitigate the risk that the model “fills in” content it
was not actually given.
What the Solution Should Solve
Your solution must demonstrably solve the following scenarios. Each should be accompanied
by a worked example in your submission.

1. Unified Natural-Language Query: A user asks a question in natural language. The system
determines which platforms are relevant, retrieves permission-filtered context from each, and
returns a single grounded answer with citations (links back to source
documents/tickets/messages/files).
Example: A backend engineer asks, “What’s the status of the database migration project and
were there any blockers raised in Slack last week?” The system > pulls Jira issues from the
migration project, Slack messages from relevant channels the engineer is a member of, and
returns a synthesized answer with citations > — omitting any Slack threads from private
channels the engineer is not in.
2. Data Freshness: The system must return answers grounded in relatively recent data, not
stale snapshots. When a document, ticket, message, or file is created or updated in any source
platform (Confluence, Jira, Slack, Google Drive), it must become available in the Internal
Brain's answers within a bounded, predictable window — on the order of minutes to ~1 hour —
so that the assistant never silently serves outdated content as if it were current. The data must
not be stale.
Example: An on-call engineer asks at 2:05 PM, "What's the latest runbook for the paymentservice incident?" The runbook owner pushed a critical update to the Confluence page at 1:00
PM — adding a new failover step. The system must surface the updated runbook, including the
new step, not a pre-update version cached from the morning's ingestion. Had the system
served the stale version, the engineer would have missed a failover action that could prolong
the outage.

3. Correct Permission Enforcement (The Negative Cases): The system must refuse or filter
when the asker lacks permission, without revealing that the restricted content exists (to avoid a
metadata side-channel).
• Example: A contractor asks, “Show me the security incident report from the Q3 breach.” The
report lives in a Confluence space restricted to the security team. The system returns an
answer that does not contain the report’s contents — and does not confirm or deny the
report’s existence beyond what the user’s permissions already imply.
4. Live Permission Change Handling: When a user’s access is revoked (e.g., removed from
a Slack channel, a Confluence page is restricted), subsequent queries must reflect that
change. The system must not serve content the user can no longer access.
5. Audit Inquiry: A compliance officer can query the audit trail to reconstruct what any user
asked, what was retrieved on their behalf, and what was answered — with timestamps and
authorization decisions.
• Example: “Show me everything user ‘jdoe’ accessed related to the ‘payment-gateway’
Confluence space in the last 30 days.”
The Solution Should Include
• Demo Walkthrough – A live demonstration.
• Architecture Diagram – architecture, trust-boundary diagram, key design trade-offs and etc.
• Source Code – Complete source code submitted through a GitHub repository.
Note: The features listed above are provided as guidance only. Participants are strongly
encouraged to explore alternative approaches that meaningfully address the problem
statement.

The Solution Should Be
• Empowering — Help patients take greater ownership of their health rather than simply issue
reminders.
• Personalised — Adapt recommendations to the user's conditions, medications, goals and
circumstances.
• Longitudinal — Learn from and respond to changes in the user's health over time.
• Safe — Recognise the limits of self-care and direct medication or clinical concerns to
appropriate professionals.
• Practical — Translate health information into achievable actions that fit everyday life.
• Strictly bounded — never crosses from explanation into medication advice.
• Honest about uncertainty — able to say "I'm not able to identify that medication, please
check with your pharmacist.”
